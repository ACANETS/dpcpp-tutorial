# Lab 4: Static Analysis and Run-time Profiling 

This page contains the instructions of Lab 4 for EECE.6540 Heterogeneous Computing at UMass Lowell.

We use matrix multiplication example to show how to use Intel's FPGA optimization tools for analyzing and optimizing a DPC++ design. Specifically we show how to use compilation reports to analyze a design and how to perform run-time profiling. A few design options are compared side by side in terms of programming APIs, resource utilization, area and performance.

| Optimized for                     | Description
|:---                               |:---
| OS                                | Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04
| Hardware                          | Skylake with GEN9 or newer, Intel(R) Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel(R) Arria(R) 10 GX FPGA
| Software                          | Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++ Compiler (beta)  
  
The compilation and run-time profiling are performed on Intel FPGA DevCloud, a free development platform.

## Purpose

We use matrix-multi example to demonstrate the design and optimization flow for DPC++ programs targeted for FPGA hardware. 

DPC++ supports kernel functions that define how computation is carried out on a partition of the whole dataset or task. It is important to understand different design options and seek the best suitable design for a particular algorithm. Due to the unique characteristics of FPGA targets, Intel provides a set of tools we can leverage to investigate resource utilizations and identify bottlenecks. Lab 4 is to demonstrate the usage of these tools with `matrix-multi' example.

## Key Implementation Details 

The DPC++ implementations explained in the several versions covers basic concepts of DPC++ programming such as device selector, parallel_for(), single_task(), loop unrolling. In the st-v3 version, we introduce the tile concept that relies on the usage of local memory to reduce the cost of accessing global memory.

## Part I: Static Analysis with Compiler-generated Reports

### On DevCloud

**The project uses CMake. Perform the following steps to build different targets.** 

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make report
```

* make report : generate static report on the FPGA resource utilization of the designs. 

For each design (each .cpp file in src/ folder), a folder containing reports will be generated after executing "make report". For example, a folder called "matrix-multi-st-v1_report.prj/" is created for source code "matrix-multi-st-v1.cpp". In this folder, there is a subdirectory called "reports/", which in turn contains the results obtained from the DPC++ compiler. You will need to copy the entire 'reports' folder from DevCloud to your local computer by following the next few steps.

1) On DevCloud, create a tar ball for the "reports/" folder (using v1 as an example in this case.)
```
    cd matrix-multi-st-v1_report.prj/
    tar zcvf reports-v1.tgz reports/
    pwd
```
* 'pwd' shows you the full path of the tar ball file, for example, /home/uxxxxx/projects/dpcpp-tutorial/matrix-multi/build/matrix-multi-st-v1_report.prj . You need to record this path so that the following scp command can copy the tar ball file.

### On Local Computer

2) On your local computer, use scp to copy the reports-v1.tgz from DevCloud to a local folder.
```
    scp devcloud:/home/uxxxxx/projects/dpcpp-tutorial/matrix-multi/build/matrix-multi-st-v1_report.prj/reports-v1.tgz .
```
Note that you need to replace the full path with the output from your 'pwd' command in Step 1).

If this command completes successfully, you will see 'reports-v1.tgz' appear in your local folder.

3) On your local computer, untar the tar ball file to extract the full content under "reports" folder.
```
    tar zxvf reports-v1.tgz
```
Alternatively, you can double-click the tar file (reports-v1.tgz) to extract the full content. Either way, you should see a folder named "reports" created on your local computer.

4) View the static analysis of your design using a browser. You can open the file named "report.html" using your favorite browser and navigate through different report sections (Summary, Throughput, Area, System Viewers). Detailed explainations are available in [IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Optimization Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide.html)
